      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi! I graduated from Guelph-Humber with a BA in Business. I currently work in Operations at TD.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Toronto!</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Baking, dabbling on the piano, watching asmr/mukbang videos</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Owning my own little bakery</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Never moved outside of Toronto</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I think that a career as a web developer would be challenging and exciting, it would be totally different than what I learned in school, and what I currently do at work. I love creating things and would love to be able to create nifty and and innovative websites and apps. </p>
